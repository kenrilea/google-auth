__SUMMARY__

- The main HTML file link scripts.
	- data
	- enemy
	- engine-utilities
	- Engine
	- Player
	- main
	- text

 - in data we set
	- the game width to 375
	- the gam height to 500
	- the enemy width to 75
	- the enemy height to 156
	- the max enemies to 3
	- the player width to 75
	- the player height to 54
in enemy we make a class
	- there is a function update(timeDiff)
		- moves the enemy by incrementing this.y
		- if the Y would put the enemy outside of the screen
		  it should be destroyed (this.removeChild)
	- the constructor takes two parameters (theRoot,enemySpot)
		- properties are: root,spot,x,y,speed
			- dom element img
			- the img src is images/enemysprit.png
			- position is absolute
			- location x of img
			- location y of img
			- img is added to the root
			- this.Zindex = 5
in player we make a class
	- the constuctor takes one argument, root
	- has parameters: x,y,
			- dom element img
			- the img src is images/player.png
			- position is absolute
			- location x of img
			- location y of img
			- img is added to the root
			- this.Zindex = 10
	- move left parameter that moves one player width left
	- move right function that moves one player width right
in engine utilities we
	- create a function /*nextEnemySpot*/ that takes one parameter
	  enemies
		-two variables one for possible slots so game_width/enemy_width
		- one for spots taken so like an array of false
		- for every enemey that exists set the slot they are in
		  to false
		- choose a candidate slot by randomizing through the taken
		  slots
		- returns the candidate slot
	- create a function to add the background takes one argument which
	  is the root of the function
		- create an image element
		- src is the path
		- height is game height
		- width is game width
		- add it to the root
		- create a div called white box
		- z index 100
		- position absolute
		- height width and top are game width ect
		- add the div to the root
in the engine we create a class Engine
- we crete a function gameloop
	- if the last frame doesnt exist or time has elapsed
	  send the time dif to the enemies
	- remove enemies that have been destroyed
	- add enemies untill enemies is = max enemies
	- if the plater is dead window.alert("game over")
	- return nothing
	- set timeout on the gameloop 20ms
- need an is played dead function that returns false if they are dead
- the constructor takes THEROOT cretes properties
	- root
	- player = this.newplayer
	- and array of enemies
	- add the background to the root
in the main file we need
- create a class from the Engine new Engine(doccument.getElementById("app"))
- create a function to handle key presses
	- takes the keypress as an argument
	- if the left arrow is down call the moveleft functino
	- if the right arrow is down call the moveright function
	- add an event listen to the doccument for keydown that calls
	  keydownhandler
-call the gameloop function

in the text file
- create a class called text
	- constructor takes the root xpos and ypos
	- need a div
	- position
